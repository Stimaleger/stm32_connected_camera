# Connected camera

Connected camera using STM32 and GSM module. (work still in progress)

## Introduction

The goal of this personnal project was to build a custom board based on STM32 MCU interfaced with a camera using DCMI interface and communicate with a GSM module to make a connected camera.
In fine I would like to make it works on a battery with a PIR sensor, in order to make a connected alarm.

The board has been developped using Altium designer and the embedded software with STM32CubeIDE.

Another objectif of this project was to discover the STM32 MCU and it's environent.
